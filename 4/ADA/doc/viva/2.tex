\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*. ]
	\item What Is Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm ?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a
				weighted undirected graph
			\item The main idea behind this algorithm is that we want to take all the nodes of the
				graph and greedily connect them with minimum-weight edges
			\item We start with an empty MST and keep track of two sets of nodes
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In the first set, we'll keep all the nodes added in the MST
				\item In the second set, we'll store all the nodes that are not added to the MST
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item What are the differences between Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms ?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Both Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms are used to find the shortest path between
				two nodes in a graph
			\item However, Dijkstra's algorithm is used when all the edge weights are non-negative,
				while Prim's algorithm can be used with any kind of edge weights
			\item Prim's algorithm is also faster than Dijkstra's algorithm when the graph is dense
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item How does Prim's algorithm differ from Kruskal's algorithm ?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the minimum spanning tree by
				starting with a single vertex and adding in edges until all vertices are
				included
			\item Kruskal's algorithm is also a greedy algorithm, but it builds the minimum
				spanning tree by starting with all edges and adding them in until there is a
				tree that includes all vertices
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
