\begin{enumerate}[label=Step \arabic* : ,itemindent=1.5em]
		\item Input the number of vertices \texttt{n} and the cost matrix \texttt{c[][]}
		\item Initialize an array \texttt{parent[]} to store the parent of each vertex,
			initially all set to 0
		\item Initialize \texttt{ne} (number of edges in the minimum spanning tree) and
			\texttt{mincost} (total cost of the minimum spanning tree) to 0
		\item Repeat the following steps until \texttt{ne} becomes \texttt{n-1}
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*) ]
				\item Find the edge with the minimum weight that connects two disjoint
					components
				\item Merge the two components by setting the parent of one component's
					root to the other component's root
				\item Update \texttt{mincost} by adding the weight of the selected edge
					to it
				\item Mark the selected edge as visited by setting its weight to a
					large value (i.e 9999)
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Print the minimum spanning tree edges and the total cost \texttt{mincost}
	\end{enumerate}
